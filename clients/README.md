## Code Generated API Clients

This directory contains generated API clients based
on our feature definitions. The files in this directory
were generated using [chalk codegen](https://docs.chalk.ai/cli/codegen).

We've also taken care to add `clients/` to the `.chalkignore` 
file, as otherwise when we run `chalk apply`, we would
find duplicate definitions of our features.
